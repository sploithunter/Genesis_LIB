Below is an integrated, “single-source-of-truth” table that fuses the **Task Outline** with the **Milestone Schedule** so you can track scope, timing, deliverables, acceptance and payment in one place. All month numbers are relative to Contract Award (CA).

\* Task 9 delivers an intermediate demo around month 12 (to feed Task 5) and the full heterogeneous-framework demo by CA + 18, culminating in the final integrated release that feeds the CA + 21 final report.

**Notes**

* **Task 11 (Project Management)** runs the full 21 months and governs schedule, risk, stakeholder TIMs, and reporting. It has no discrete milestone payment but underpins every milestone review.
* Where wording varied slightly between the two source sections, the phrasing above preserves the scope from the Task Outline while retaining the formal deliverable language and payment triggers from the Milestone Schedule.

This consolidated view should let you copy one table into your project tracker or contractual attachment and avoid flipping between sections.
