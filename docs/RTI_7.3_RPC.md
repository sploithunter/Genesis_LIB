classrti.rpc.Service(service_instance: ABC, participant: DomainParticipant, service_name: str, task_count: int = 4, datawriter_qos: Optional[DataWriterQos] = None, datareader_qos: Optional[DataReaderQos] = None, publisher: Optional[Publisher] = None, subscriber: Optional[Subscriber] = None)
A service allows running a service_instance in a DDS domain using asyncio.

The service useses a Replier to receive RPC calls and then dispatches them to the service_instance, calling the appropriate method. The value returned by the method is then sent back to the remote caller.

The service runs asynchronously (run method) until the task is cancelled.

close()
Closes the DDS entities used by this service.

propertymatched_client_count: int
The number of RPC clients that match this service.

asyncrun(close_on_cancel: bool = False)
Starts receiving RPC calls (requests) and processing them.

This method runs until the task it returns is cancelled.

If close_on_cancel is True, the service will close the DDS entities when the task is canceled. By default it is False, which means you can call run() again after a run() task is cancelled.

Exceptions raised during the execution of the service are logged as warnings module and do not stop the execution of the service.

classrti.rpc.ClientBase(participant: ~rti.connextdds.DomainParticipant, service_name: str, max_wait_per_call: ~rti.connextdds.Duration = <rti.connextdds.Duration object>, datawriter_qos: ~typing.Optional[~rti.connextdds.DataWriterQos] = None, datareader_qos: ~typing.Optional[~rti.connextdds.DataReaderQos] = None, publisher: ~typing.Optional[~rti.connextdds.Publisher] = None, subscriber: ~typing.Optional[~rti.connextdds.Subscriber] = None)
Base class for RPC clients.

An actual Client must inherit from a service interface and from this class, for example:

` class RobotClient(Robot, rpc.ClientBase): ... `

This base class injects an implementation for all the @operation methods found in Robot, which uses a Requester to make RPC calls and return the values it receives.

The base class also provides an __init__, close and other methods.

close()
Closes the DDS entities used by this client.

propertymatched_service_count: int
The number of RPC services that match this client.

@rti.rpc.service(cls=None, *, type_annotations=[], member_annotations={})
This decorator marks an abstract base class as a remote service interface.

A class annotated with this decorator can be used to create a Client or to define the implementation to be run in a Service.

The operations that will be remotely callable need to be marked with the @operation decorator.

@rti.rpc.operation(funcobj=None, *, raises=[], parameter_annotations={})
This decorator marks a method as an remote operation of a service interface.

It also marks it as an @abc.abstractmethod.

Only methods marked with this decorator will be callable using an RPC Client or an RPC Service.

exceptionrti.rpc.RemoteUnknownOperationError
Exception thrown by a client operation when the server indicates that the operation is unknown to the server.

exceptionrti.rpc.RemoteUnknownExceptionError
Exception thrown by a client operation when the server operation fails with an exception that is not declared in the interface.
