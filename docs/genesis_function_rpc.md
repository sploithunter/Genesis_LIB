# Genesis Function RPC System Explained

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Genesis Function RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system, primarily used for communication between Agents and Function providers (Services). The core design principle is **dynamic discovery**: callers (Agents) do not need prior knowledge of available functions, their names, or their specific parameters. All necessary information is discovered at runtime through DDS (Data Distribution Service) mechanisms.

This system leverages RTI Connext DDS and its RPC capabilities (`rti.rpc`) but builds significant abstractions on top for function registration, discovery, monitoring, and standardized request/reply handling, particularly within the `GenesisRPCService` and `EnhancedServiceBase` classes.

Understanding this system is crucial for maintaining existing function services and for designing the new Interface-to-Agent RPC system, aiming to reuse its successful patterns while adhering to the desired communication hierarchy (Interface <-> Agent <-> Function).

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. Data Model (`genesis_lib/datamodel.py`)

These Python classes, decorated with `@idl.struct`, define the data structures exchanged over DDS for function RPC. They map directly to DDS types defined potentially in XML (`datamodel.xml`) but are used programmatically as Python classes.

*   **`Function`**: Represents the definition of a single function available for remote calls.
    *   `name: str`: The name of the function (e.g., "add", "get_weather").
    *   `description: str`: A human-readable description of what the function does.
    *   `parameters: str`: **Crucially**, this is a *JSON string* representing the JSON Schema definition of the function's expected parameters (following OpenAI's function/tool schema format). This schema is used by the Agent to understand how to format arguments and potentially by the service for validation.
    *   `strict: bool`: If `True`, the service attempts to validate incoming arguments against the `parameters` schema.

*   **`Tool`**: An OpenAI-style container, currently always of type "function".
    *   `type: str`: Always "function".
    *   `function: Function`: Embeds the `Function` definition. Services register `Tool` objects.

*   **`FunctionCall`**: Represents the details of a *specific* function invocation *within* a request.
    *   `name: str`: The name of the function *to be called*.
    *   `arguments: str`: A *JSON string* containing the actual arguments for the function call, formatted according to the schema defined in the corresponding `Function`'s `parameters`.

*   **`FunctionRequest`**: The main structure sent by a caller (Agent) to invoke a function.
    *   `id: str`: A unique identifier for this specific request, often used for correlation (though RTI RPC handles correlation implicitly).
    *   `type: str`: Always "function".
    *   `function: FunctionCall`: Embeds the `FunctionCall` details specifying *which* function to call and *with what* arguments.

*   **`FunctionReply`**: The main structure sent back by the service (Function provider) to the caller (Agent).
    *   `result_json: str`: A *JSON string* containing the result of the function execution. Can be complex JSON.
    *   `success: bool`: Indicates whether the function executed successfully.
    *   `error_message: str`: If `success` is `False`, this contains a description of the error.

**Implementation Note:** Consistent use of these specific classes and their fields is vital. Arguments and results are *always* JSON strings within these structures. Parsing and serialization happen within the RPC service logic.

### 2.2. Base RPC Service (`genesis_lib/rpc_service.py`)

*   **`GenesisRPCService`**: The fundamental base class for creating RPC services that expose functions.
    *   **`__init__(self, service_name: str)`**:
        *   Initializes the DDS `DomainParticipant`.
        *   Creates an `rti.rpc.Replier` instance. This is the core DDS entity that listens for incoming requests and sends replies.
            *   `request_type`: Set by `self.get_request_type()`, defaults to `FunctionRequest`.
            *   `reply_type`: Set by `self.get_reply_type()`, defaults to `FunctionReply`.
            *   `participant`: The DDS participant.
            *   `service_name`: This name is used by `rti.rpc.Replier` primarily to **derive the default DDS Topic names** for the request and reply types (e.g., `CalculatorServiceRequest`, `CalculatorServiceReply`). While important for DDS discovery of the *RPC endpoint itself*, it's **not** used by callers to discover *what functions* the service provides. That happens via the separate Function Discovery mechanism (see Section 3.1). It serves mainly for debugging and identifying the RPC service endpoint within DDS tools.
        *   Initializes `self.functions: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}`: This dictionary is crucial. It maps registered function names (strings) to dictionaries containing their implementation (`"implementation": Callable`), their schema/description (`"tool": Tool`), and potentially other metadata.

    *   **`get_request_type(self)` / `get_reply_type(self)`**: Return the Python classes (`FunctionRequest`, `FunctionReply`) used for this RPC service. Allows potential overriding but is standard for function services.

    *   **`register_function(self, func, description, parameters, ...)`**:
        *   Takes the Python function (`func`), its description, and its parameter schema (as a Python `dict`).
        *   Validates the parameter schema (`validate_schema`).
        *   Creates the `Function` and `Tool` objects from `datamodel.py`.
        *   Stores the function implementation and its `Tool` definition in the `self.functions` dictionary, keyed by the function's name (`func.__name__`).

    *   **`async run(self)`**:
        *   The main asynchronous loop that handles incoming requests.
        *   Enters an infinite loop waiting for requests using `self.replier.receive_requests(...)`. This blocks until requests arrive or the timeout occurs.
        *   Iterates through received `request_sample`s.
        *   Extracts the `request = request_sample.data` (which is an instance of `FunctionRequest`) and `request_info = request_sample.info` (containing DDS metadata like the caller's identity).
        *   Retrieves `function_name` and `arguments_json` from `request.function`.
        *   **Looks up** the `function_name` in its `self.functions` dictionary.
        *   If found:
            *   Retrieves the actual Python function implementation (`func = self.functions[function_name]["implementation"]`).
            *   Parses the `arguments_json` string into a Python dictionary (`args_data`).
            *   **(Optional)** If `strict=True` in the function's `Tool` definition, validates `args_data` against the schema stored in the `Tool`.
            *   **Injects** the `request_info` into the arguments dictionary (`args_data["request_info"] = request_info`). This allows the function implementation to know about the caller if needed (e.g., for monitoring).
            *   **Calls** the actual function implementation: `result = func(**args_data)`. Handles both regular functions and `async` functions.
            *   Serializes the `result` back into a JSON string (`result_json`).
            *   Creates a `FunctionReply` instance with `success=True` and the `result_json`.
        *   If the function name is not found, or if argument parsing/validation/execution fails:
            *   Logs the error appropriately.
            *   Creates a `FunctionReply` instance with `success=False` and a descriptive `error_message`.
        *   Sends the `FunctionReply` back to the specific caller using `self.replier.send_reply(reply, request_sample.info)`. The `request_sample.info` ensures the reply is correlated to the original request by the underlying RTI RPC mechanism.
        *   Includes `try...except` blocks for robust error handling during the request processing lifecycle.

    *   **`close(self)`**: Cleans up DDS resources (`Replier`, `Participant`).

**Implementation Note:** The `run` method's logic for looking up functions in `self.functions`, parsing/validating arguments, calling the implementation, and handling results/errors is the core request-processing pipeline.

### 2.3. Enhanced RPC Service (`genesis_lib/enhanced_service_base.py`)

*   **`EnhancedServiceBase`**: Inherits from `GenesisRPCService` and adds significant capabilities, primarily function discovery/advertisement and enhanced monitoring. Services like `CalculatorService` typically inherit from this class.
    *   **`__init__(self, service_name, capabilities, participant=None, domain_id=0, registry: FunctionRegistry = None)`**:
        *   Calls `super().__init__(service_name)`.
        *   Sets up DDS entities for **monitoring** (writers for `MonitoringEvent`, `ComponentLifecycleEvent`, `ChainEvent`, `LivelinessUpdate`). Uses `DynamicData` and types loaded from XML via `dds.QosProvider`.
        *   Initializes `FunctionRegistry` (from `genesis_lib/function_discovery.py`) if not provided. The registry is responsible for interacting with the DDS layer for advertising and discovering `FunctionCapability` data.
        *   Creates and sets an `EnhancedFunctionCapabilityListener` on the registry's reader to react to discovery events (e.g., logging matches, potentially triggering actions when other services/functions appear).
        *   Stores `self.app_guid` (derived from the registry's DDS writer instance handle) for unique service identification in monitoring.
        *   Calls `self._auto_register_decorated_functions()` to automatically register methods decorated with `@genesis_function`.

    *   **`_auto_register_decorated_functions(self)`**: Scans the class instance for methods decorated with `@genesis_function` (see `genesis_lib/decorators.py`) and calls `register_enhanced_function` for each.

    *   **`register_enhanced_function(self, func, description, parameters, ...)`**:
        *   A wrapper around the base class's `register_function`.
        *   Logs the enhanced registration process.
        *   Calls `self.function_wrapper(func_name)(func)` to wrap the user's function implementation with monitoring logic *before* registering it.
        *   Calls the base `self.register_function` with the *wrapped* function.

    *   **`function_wrapper(self, func_name)`**: (Implemented as a decorator factory)
        *   This is a key part of the enhanced monitoring. It returns a decorator that wraps the actual function implementation.
        *   The `wrapper` function inside the decorator:
            *   Extracts `request_info` from the called function's `kwargs`.
            *   Extracts call arguments (`call_data`).
            *   Publishes `ComponentLifecycleEvent` (state -> BUSY) and `ChainEvent` (type -> CALL_START) *before* calling the original function. Includes correlation IDs (`chain_id`, `call_id`).
            *   Calls the original function implementation (`result = func(*args, **kwargs)`).
            *   Publishes `ChainEvent` (type -> CALL_COMPLETE) and `ComponentLifecycleEvent` (state -> READY) *after* the function returns successfully.
            *   If the function raises an exception:
                *   Publishes `ChainEvent` (type -> CALL_ERROR) and `ComponentLifecycleEvent` (state -> DEGRADED).
                *   Re-raises the exception so the base `run` method can catch it and send an error `FunctionReply`.

    *   **`_publish_monitoring_event(...)` / `publish_component_lifecycle_event(...)`**: Helper methods to construct and publish various DDS monitoring messages using the dedicated monitoring writers. They handle creating `DynamicData`, populating fields (timestamps, IDs, states, metadata), and writing to the appropriate DDS Topic.

    *   **`_advertise_functions(self)`**:
        *   This method orchestrates the advertisement of the service's registered functions so that Agents can discover them. **Crucially, this uses a separate mechanism (`FunctionCapability` DDS Topic) from the RPC endpoint discovery.**
        *   Publishes initial monitoring events indicating the service is joining/initializing/discovering (`ComponentLifecycleEvent` with categories `NODE_DISCOVERY`, `AGENT_INIT`).
        *   Iterates through `self.functions`. For each function:
            *   Retrieves its schema, description, capabilities, etc.
            *   Publishes `ComponentLifecycleEvent` (category `NODE_DISCOVERY`) for the *function itself* (using a unique ID for the function node).
            *   Publishes `ComponentLifecycleEvent` (category `EDGE_DISCOVERY`) to represent the link between the *service application* (`self.app_guid`) and the *function node* it hosts.
            *   Calls `self.registry.register_function(...)`. This translates the function's details into a `FunctionCapability` structure (defined in `genesis_lib/function_discovery.py`, similar to `datamodel.xml` definition) and **publishes it on the `FunctionCapability` DDS topic.** This is the core advertisement step for discovery by Agents.
        *   After advertising all functions, publishes final monitoring events indicating the service is READY (`ComponentLifecycleEvent` category `AGENT_READY`).
        *   Sets `self._functions_advertised = True`.

    *   **`async run(self)`**: Overrides the base `run`. It ensures `_advertise_functions()` is called once before calling `super().run()` to start the request handling loop. Includes `finally` block for cleanup.

    *   **`handle_function_discovery(...)` / `handle_function_removal(...)`**: Methods intended to be called by the `FunctionCapabilityListener` when *other* functions are discovered or removed from the network. Allows the service to react to changes in available functions elsewhere.

    *   **`close(self)`**: Extends the base `close` to also close the `FunctionRegistry`.

**Implementation Note:** Services providing functions should inherit from `EnhancedServiceBase`, use the `@genesis_function` decorator (or call `register_enhanced_function` directly), and the base class handles advertisement and monitored execution.

### 2.4. Function Discovery (`genesis_lib/function_discovery.py`)

While not directly part of the RPC *call* mechanism, this is essential for the dynamic nature of the system.
*   **`FunctionRegistry`**: Manages the advertisement and discovery of functions via DDS.
    *   Creates DDS DataWriters for publishing `FunctionCapability` data.
    *   Creates DDS DataReaders for discovering `FunctionCapability` data published by *other* services.
    *   Provides `register_function` which takes function details and publishes them as `FunctionCapability`.
    *   Provides ways to query discovered functions.
*   **`FunctionCapability`**: The data structure (defined via `datamodel.xml` and used with `DynamicData`) that describes a function's capabilities, including its name, description, provider ID (the service's `app_guid`), parameter schema (as a JSON string), and the crucial **`service_name`**. This `service_name` within `FunctionCapability` tells the Agent **which RPC service endpoint** (the `service_name` used when initializing the `Replier`/`Requester`) to target when it wants to call *this specific function*.
*   **`FunctionCapabilityListener`**: A DDS listener attached to the `FunctionCapability` DataReader. Its `on_data_available` method is triggered when new functions are discovered or existing ones update/disappear. `EnhancedServiceBase` uses a custom version (`EnhancedFunctionCapabilityListener`) to trigger `handle_function_discovery`/`handle_function_removal` and publish monitoring events.

**Implementation Note:** Agents use a `FunctionRegistry` (or similar discovery mechanism) to find functions. They read `FunctionCapability` samples from DDS. The `parameter_schema` tells the Agent how to structure the `arguments` JSON in the `FunctionRequest`, and the `service_name` field tells the Agent which RPC service endpoint to send the `FunctionRequest` to.

### 2.5. Underlying RTI RPC (`rti.rpc`)

*   **`rti.rpc.Replier`**: Used by the *service* (`GenesisRPCService`/`EnhancedServiceBase`). Listens on DDS topics derived from the `service_name` and `request_type`. Receives requests, allows the application (`run` loop) to process them, and sends replies back using `send_reply`, ensuring correlation.
*   **`rti.rpc.Requester`**: Used by the *caller* (Agent). Sends requests (`FunctionRequest`) using `send_request` targeted at a specific `service_name`. Receives replies (`FunctionReply`) using `receive_replies` or `read_replies`/`take_replies`. Handles request-reply correlation automatically using DDS mechanisms.

## 3. Workflow Deep Dive

### 3.1. Function Registration & Advertisement (Service Startup)

1.  A service (e.g., `CalculatorService`) inherits from `EnhancedServiceBase`.
2.  `EnhancedServiceBase.__init__` is called, setting up DDS, monitoring, and the `FunctionRegistry`.
3.  Functions are registered:
    *   Using `@genesis_function` decorator on methods (preferred).
    *   Or by explicitly calling `service.register_enhanced_function(method, description, params_schema)`.
4.  The decorator/`register_enhanced_function` calls `EnhancedServiceBase.function_wrapper` to wrap the method with monitoring logic.
5.  The wrapped function is registered with the base `GenesisRPCService.register_function`, storing it in `self.functions`.
6.  The service's `async run()` method is called.
7.  `EnhancedServiceBase.run()` calls `_advertise_functions()`.
8.  `_advertise_functions()`:
    *   Publishes initial "joining" monitoring events.
    *   Iterates through functions in `self.functions`.
    *   For each function, calls `self.registry.register_function()`.
    *   `registry.register_function()` creates a `FunctionCapability` DDS sample containing the function's name, description, parameter schema (JSON string), provider ID (`self.app_guid`), and the `service_name` of the hosting RPC service.
    *   The `FunctionCapability` sample is **published** on the globally known `FunctionCapability` DDS topic.
    *   Monitoring events (`NODE_DISCOVERY` for the function, `EDGE_DISCOVERY` linking function to service) are published.
    *   Publishes final "ready" monitoring events.
9.  `EnhancedServiceBase.run()` calls `super().run()`, starting the `GenesisRPCService.run()` request loop. The service now listens for `FunctionRequest` messages via its `Replier`.

### 3.2. Function Discovery (Agent Startup/Runtime)

1.  An Agent initializes its own DDS Participant and a `FunctionRegistry` instance (or equivalent discovery logic).
2.  The Agent's `FunctionRegistry` creates a DDS DataReader for the `FunctionCapability` topic with a Listener (`FunctionCapabilityListener`).
3.  As services advertise their functions (Step 3.1.8), the Agent's Listener receives `FunctionCapability` DDS samples.
4.  The Listener's `on_data_available` callback processes these samples.
5.  The Agent now knows:
    *   A function named `X` exists.
    *   It's described by `description`.
    *   It expects parameters defined by the JSON schema in `parameter_schema`.
    *   It is provided by the service instance identified by `provider_id`.
    *   To call it, send a `FunctionRequest` to the RPC endpoint identified by `service_name` (extracted from the `FunctionCapability` sample).
6.  The Agent typically stores this discovered function information locally (e.g., in a dictionary mapping function names to their capabilities and target service name).

### 3.3. Function Call (Agent -> Service)

1.  The Agent decides to call a discovered function (e.g., "add").
2.  It retrieves the function's details (parameter schema, target `service_name`) from its discovered function cache.
3.  It constructs the arguments dictionary (e.g., `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`) according to the discovered `parameter_schema`.
4.  It **serializes** the arguments dictionary into a JSON string: `'{"a": 1, "b": 2}'`.
5.  It creates a `FunctionCall` instance: `FunctionCall(name="add", arguments='{"a": 1, "b": 2}')`.
6.  It creates a `FunctionRequest` instance, embedding the `FunctionCall`: `FunctionRequest(id=unique_id, type="function", function=call_details)`.
7.  The Agent uses an `rti.rpc.Requester` instance, configured to communicate with the **target `service_name`** (discovered in Step 3.2.5).
8.  The Agent sends the request: `request_id = requester.send_request(function_request_object)`.
9.  The request travels via DDS to the target service's `Replier`.
10. The Service's `GenesisRPCService.run()` loop receives the request via `replier.receive_requests()`.
11. The `run` loop looks up "add" in `self.functions`.
12. It retrieves the *wrapped* implementation function.
13. It parses the `arguments` JSON string back into a dictionary.
14. It calls the wrapper function (created by `EnhancedServiceBase.function_wrapper`).
15. The wrapper publishes "CALL_START" monitoring events.
16. The wrapper calls the original `add(a=1, b=2, request_info=...)` implementation.
17. The `add` function executes and returns the result (e.g., `3`).
18. The wrapper receives the result.
19. The wrapper publishes "CALL_COMPLETE" monitoring events.
20. The wrapper returns the result (`3`) to the `run` loop.
21. The `run` loop **serializes** the result into a JSON string: `'3'` (or `'{"result": 3}'` depending on formatting).
22. It creates a `FunctionReply`: `FunctionReply(result_json='3', success=True, error_message="")`.
23. It sends the reply back using `replier.send_reply(reply, request_sample.info)`.
24. The Agent, waiting for a reply on its `Requester` (e.g., using `replies = requester.receive_replies(related_request_id=request_id)`), receives the `FunctionReply` sample.
25. The Agent extracts the `FunctionReply` object.
26. It checks `reply.success`.
27. If successful, it **parses** `reply.result_json` to get the final result (e.g., `json.loads('3') -> 3`).

## 4. Key Principles & Implementation Guidance

*   **Dynamic Discovery is Paramount**: Agents MUST rely solely on discovered `FunctionCapability` data. They should *not* have hardcoded knowledge of function names, parameter structures, or target service names. The discovery mechanism provides all necessary runtime information.
*   **Separation of Concerns**:
    *   `datamodel.py`: Defines the *data* being exchanged. Stable and fundamental.
    *   `rpc_service.py`: Provides the *basic RPC mechanics* (listening, routing calls based on name, argument parsing, result serialization, basic error handling).
    *   `enhanced_service_base.py`: Adds *advanced features* on top (monitoring, advertisement via `FunctionRegistry`, function wrapping).
    *   `function_discovery.py`: Handles the DDS interactions for *advertising and discovering* the `FunctionCapability` data.
    *   `rti.rpc`: The underlying DDS *transport* for request/reply.
*   **Role of `service_name`**: Used by `rti.rpc.Replier` and `rti.rpc.Requester` to establish the underlying DDS communication channel (Topics). It identifies the RPC *endpoint*. Agents discover *which* `service_name` endpoint hosts a *specific* function by reading the `service_name` field within the discovered `FunctionCapability` data for that function.
*   **JSON Everywhere**: Arguments (`FunctionCall.arguments`) and results (`FunctionReply.result_json`) are transported as JSON strings within the RPC data structures. Services need to parse incoming arguments from JSON; callers need to parse results from JSON. Schemas (`Function.parameters`) are also JSON strings (representing JSON Schema).
*   **Class Structures are Key**:
    *   Always use the classes defined in `genesis_lib/datamodel.py` (`FunctionRequest`, `FunctionReply`, etc.) when constructing requests/replies.
    *   Function implementations receive arguments as standard Python types after the `run` loop parses the JSON. They should return standard Python objects; the `run` loop handles serializing the return value to JSON for the `FunctionReply`.
    *   `request_info` is injected into the function call `kwargs` by `GenesisRPCService.run` if the function implementation needs DDS-level info about the caller.
*   **Monitoring**: `EnhancedServiceBase` provides robust monitoring via its function wrapper and lifecycle event publishing. This is crucial for observing system behavior. Chain and call IDs help correlate events across different components.
*   **Error Handling**: The `run` loop in `GenesisRPCService` includes broad exception handling. Errors during argument parsing, validation, or function execution result in a `FunctionReply` with `success=False` and an `error_message`. The `function_wrapper` in `EnhancedServiceBase` adds error-specific monitoring events.

## 5. Conclusion

The Genesis Function RPC system provides a robust, dynamic, and monitored way for Agents to interact with Function services without requiring compile-time knowledge. It achieves this through:
1.  Clear data models (`datamodel.py`).
2.  A layered service implementation (`rpc_service.py`, `enhanced_service_base.py`).
3.  A dedicated DDS-based discovery mechanism (`FunctionCapability`, `FunctionRegistry`).
4.  Leveraging the underlying RTI Connext RPC primitives (`rti.rpc.Replier`, `rti.rpc.Requester`).

When designing the new Interface-to-Agent RPC system, consider adopting similar patterns:
*   Define clear `AgentRequest`/`AgentReply` data structures (likely in `datamodel.py` or a new file).
*   Use a base RPC class structure (perhaps adapting `GenesisRPCService` or creating a parallel hierarchy) for handling the DDS `Replier`/`Requester` interactions.
*   Implement a discovery mechanism (if needed beyond simple service name matching) for Agents to advertise their capabilities or specific endpoints.
*   Integrate monitoring using patterns from `EnhancedServiceBase` (wrappers, lifecycle events).
*   Strictly enforce the communication hierarchy (Interfaces only talk to Agents). This might involve checks within the RPC layers or discovery mechanisms.
*   Pay close attention to data serialization (likely JSON) within the request/reply structures.
