## 1 Programmatic Information

### 1.1 Problem Description

The promise of generative AI and generative agents is very likely world changing and nowhere will this be seen more acutely than on the battlefield. AI agent augmentation in weapons platforms, training, information management, target recognition, intelligence analysis, and the myriads of other applications will be a necessary discriminator for the warfighter. Due to generative AI agent potential, PEO Digital and AFRL USAF CMSO are investing heavily in generative AI agents to interact with simulation systems. This ongoing work shows increasing promise due to the exponential performance gains in general LLMs and agent frameworks; however, they have identified several technology gaps to their goal of a "safe, secure, reliable" integration of generative AI agents into simulation environments. Beyond implementation specifics, DAF suffers the same integration hurdles that the larger commercial tech industry suffers from, which is integration of these independent generative agents into a cohesive framework integrated with a meaningful system, commonly called "completing the stack". In short, DAF has promising AI technologies that will be a force multiplier for the warfighter and a robust simulation environment; however, DAF lacks a "safe, secure, reliable" bridging stack to make it all work together. They require a standardized, stable, robust framework for AI agent interaction between agents, humans, and the target environment that allows for rapid deployment and integration of cutting-edge AI technologies.

Over the course of months of discussions with PEO Digital and USAF CMSO on this topic, we have identified the three challenges below and we frame them in PEO Digital's "safe, secure, and reliable" theme:

-   **C1. Safe:** Safety within a multi-agent framework is all about dealing with complexity. AI models and agents are largely non-deterministic and heavily rely on correct prompting to achieve desirable results. Generative AI prompting has become its own field to guide generative AI down the correct paths to success. Managing prompts (system and user), context, and the correct and limited delivery of this information will be a primary challenge in this project. Agent performance is a unique challenge to the generative AI problem set that seeks to achieve agent decision reliability through prompts, in-context learning, training, and machine learning. In a multi-agent environment, this contextual data must be made available synchronously for machine and in context learning, and asynchronously for model training.
-   **C2. Secure:** All current AI agent frameworks rely on basic security measures like wire encryption (if at all), which is insufficient for comprehensive security. Implementing advanced security capabilities, include authentication, encryptions, and access control is crucial, yet challenging due to the interconnected nature of distributed AI agents. To make matters more complex, AI models (and consequently their agents) can be socially engineered by manipulating prompts, system prompts, and any other in context messaging
-   **C3. Reliable:** Reliability challenges can be separated into three categories. Reliability in agent integration; reliability in messaging; and reliability system integration. The primary challenge in multi-agent interaction and integration lie in the fact there is no standard communication layer that exists between agent frameworks (and in some instances, within agent frameworks). These communication connections must currently be home grown and while narrow scope interactions between two agents is trivial, a fully distributed agentic framework is complex in the extreme. In the same light, messaging reliability in the simple context is trivial but becomes quit complex in a distributed system with multicast messages. Further, none of the challenges in system integration are likely to be trivial and are currently the significant hurdle for even "one-off" agents to become useful.

### 1.2 The Opportunity

In response to the challenges encountered by PEO Digital and AFRL USAF CMSO in their effort to bring generative AI to warfighter training & operational use, we propose to build a Data-Centric Distributed Agentic Framework called **GENESIS: Gen-AI Network for Enhanced Simulation Integration and Security** (see Figure 1).

_Figure 1: GENESIS will help unleash the power of generative AI for warfighter training and operational use cases._

We identified the following set of high-level requirements that, if addressed, will enable the design and development of a safe, secure, reliable, and interoperable AI agent framework. They form the basis of our proposal to design and develop the GENESIS framework.

-   **R1. Safe:** GENESIS will require semantic level monitoring sufficient to use data for future training and/or in-context learning for system repeatability, correction, and safety. This data must be available for access both synchronously and asynchronously.
-   **R2. Secure:** GENESIS will require agent and interface level access control. This access control must be authenticated with industry standard security mechanisms and used to maintain secure during message transit. Further, GENESIS must also employ semantic security to prevent unintentional or malicious misbehaviors unique to generative AI agents.
-   **R3. Reliable:** GENESIS will require a standardized, open communication layer for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human communication with supporting integrations into common agent frameworks (Semantic Kernel, LangChain), AI programming languages (Python, C#, Javascript), and model inference endpoints (HTTPS). This communication layer must be robust, scale, and preferably tested in relevant environments. Finally, GENESIS must integrate with Simulink during the Phase II with a target integration with AFSIM in post Phase II follow on efforts. Within the timeframe and funding of the Phase II effort, our objective is to address each of these requirements though the design and implementation of a generative, multi-agent communication framework that is safe, secure, and reliable by using an industry leading, robust communication framework that is battletested in more than 1,400 DoD applications.

### 1.3 Brief Description of RTI's Core Technology

Real-Time Innovations, Inc. (RTI) is a commercial software vendor. We develop a secure, real-time communications high assurance framework for both industrial and defense systems. RTI Connext DDS is a set of developer tools, a software library that is compiled into an application, and additional runtime services that enhance its use; it provides all of the distributed communications services needed within any system. RTI Connext DDS developer licenses, support, and services accounts for most of RTI's revenue – approximately $50M in 2023. Our customers buy RTI Connext DDS because it provides all of the distributed communications needs for their small to extremely large critical distributed systems. It is scalable, secure, robust, proven, and promotes MOSA. It enables them to build their systems using less code and more modularity, substantially reducing the cost of their systems.

Connext DDS implements the OMG DDS standard. The standard ensures that all compliant products are interoperable at both the wire level and API level. This means that applications built by different teams using various competing vendor products will all interoperate with very little effort. RTI Connext DDS is in over 1,700 commercial applications and 600 research programs, including: NASA's KSC launch system, simulators, autonomous/electric commercial vehicles, ground stations, aircraft, ships, satellites, medical devices, power utilities, and many other mission-critical systems. It has also been used as the foundation for HWIL simulation and testing for both ground and airborne vehicles (e.g, Volkswagen, Passaro/Airbus). Key to this effort, DDS provides access control/security, self-discovery, years of operational deployment in critical systems, scales to incredibly large environments, and is an open standard with both open source and many commercial implementations.

In the following discussion, we describe the DDS standard in general, and not just our commercial product, which is fully DDS compliant. This also applies to other commercial implementations of DDS.

DDS is data centric – it treats data as a first-class citizen. Most other communications solutions are message centric and send their data over the network as opaque payloads that the network cannot understand. Only the applications themselves do because all of the knowledge about encoding and decoding the data rests with them. This forces every application to reinvent features for reliability, security, fault tolerance, scalability, and end to end interoperability.

In contrast, data centric means that developers naturally define open data models that describe the structure of the data that will move between applications. This allows DDS to automatically handle encoding, security, optimized/reliable delivery, and more. It also means that the government can own the interfaces, while the prime owns the implementation. DDS offers the government a real path to modular open system architectures (MOSA).

RTI Connext DDS is a loosely-coupled, and fully decentralized communications framework. This makes it possible to scale systems quickly, without recompiling or shutting the systems down. Instead of creating brittle, point-to-point network dependencies, DDS communicates over the concept of topics. Applications simply declare what kind of data (topics) they are interested in and DDS delivers it. This eliminates the brittleness of requiring endpoints to identify their communications peers – DDS handles all of this via a dynamic discovery handshake process, so developers can focus on application code rather than reinventing how to send data over the network.

DDS provides fine-grained read/write access control to the data. While encrypting all communications is generally useful when a system only wants to restrict subsets of the data this approach will not work. Using DDS fine-grained access control guarantees that only authorized applications receive this data – enabling highly customizable multi-level secure communications. This is software-defined security.

Finally, the loosely coupled nature of DDS and its use of topics to communicate both support location-independent processing. This promotes system modularity and resilience, a key benefit of MOSA system design.

## 2 Phase II Effort

### 2.1 High-Level Summary

RTI brings two major non-defense commercial solutions to this proposal. First is our TRL-9 Connext product, which is an interoperable implementation of the OMG DDS standard in use in 1,440 DoD applications as well as supported by Simulink/MATLAB, the target environment identified by PEO Digital. Second is our TRL-2 distributed generative AI framework, based on the DDS standard, which was used as a feasibility study to derisk the use of DDS as a communication framework for inter-agent communication. We currently do not have competition – our solution is a unified framework that will facilitate the integration of, and interaction between, existing agent frameworks.

_Figure 2: GENESIS will provide Full Stack Multi-Agent Simulation Integration – it will enable DAF systems to rapidly reap the potential from dynamically interacting AI agents. GENESIS is an open-standards, modular, secure, and reliable framework that will make it possible to quickly integrate AI agents from many contractors and other sources._
