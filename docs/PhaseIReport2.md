1	Programmatic Information
1.1	Problem Description 
Generative AI is the one of the fastest growing fields in human history [4]. Prominent research results from industry leaders in OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, and others have begun to show significant performance advantages by placing foundational and specialized generative transformers into agent architectures, giving the models forms of perception, action, and structure to promote desired behaviors.  This agent research has been so promising that frontier model providers have begun to state publicly that concerted efforts are underway to increase both reasoning and action performance in frontier models [5]. 
DAF PEO Digital and AFRL Enterprise Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (MS&A) have also recognized that generative AI agents will be transformative in nearly all parts of military operations beginning with Simulation.  We have shared our experiences, experimental results, and conclusions with DAF PEO Digital and AFRL MS&A.  After the conclusion of multiple discussions, it was clear that DAF PEO Digital and AFRL MS&A had identified a technology gap between emerging generative AI agent capability and the requirement for these agents to work in concert with other agents and humans in a target simulation environment, while remaining safe, secure, and reliable [6]. 
This SBIR effort will help to inform the DAF about the potential of next-generation distributed agent frameworks to 1) deliver an open, modular, scalable, and secure development and execution environment, and 2) use it to reap compounded returns by enabling tens to hundreds of collaborative agents to collectively work together.
Today, while industry has produced many agent frameworks to extend the capabilities of generative AI, the focus has been on conceptual demonstrations to evaluate interacting agent capabilities in a single process.  While some of these are becoming quite elaborate and capable, they focus on single process / single code base frameworks that inherently lack the distributed agent/human collaboration that is a primary component to the vision of generative AI agents in the enterprise.  Further, these systems leave it up to individual developers to integrate these agents with relevant systems.  
In order to reap the substantial benefits of generative AI (Gen AI), industrial and academic research has shown there is a significant leap in performance from when using multiple collaborating agents.  However, in large defense systems these agents will be provided by many sources/contractors.  Today, no such framework exists that will facilitate the development, testing, integration, and execution of large-scale heterogeneous agent-based systems.  Without a unifying framework, the DAF will end up with stovepipes of excellence that will not interoperate.  This will not only reduce the effectiveness of these solutions, but it will also cost the DAF both time and money to redundantly pay for numerous competing, non-interoperable solutions to be built.  

We are exploring the first framework of its kind that is focused on an open solution to facilitate the large-scale development of scalable and secure agent-based solutions.  It will eliminate stovepipes of excellence by providing standardized interfaces to enable agent technology interoperability, enabling rapid advancements in agent solutions for the DAF.

1.2	The Opportunity 
In response to the industries shortcomings in a foundational multi-agent framework, RTI began work on Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) generative multi-agent framework, code named GENESIS (Gen-AI Network for Enhanced Simulation Integrations and Security) – see Figure 1.  To be clear, GENESIS does not attempt to replace agent frameworks, but instead solve the heavy-lift integration and security issues associated with incorporating multiple agents into real systems.  The 40,000 ft goal of GENESIS is to allow agents to work with other agents, data, and humans, regardless of agent framework or languages used, in a safe, secure, and reliable manner.  
GENESIS uses OMG DDS as a base communication layer for inter-agent communication and leverages DDS’s broad integration support with Simulink (the target environment specified by PEO Digital) [1].  GENESIS will provide safety through monitoring and logging of all agent communications and making that data available through API for system optimization.  GENESIS will provide security through DDS’s security layer, providing client-side access control and authentication and by providing a semantic security layer to allow for monitoring of agent input/output [2].  GENESIS will provide security, scalability, and reliability by building on top of RTI’s $100M investment in Connext DDS as a MOSA critical infrastructure communication framework, including its support for robust discovery and content filtering [3].
In general, because OMG DDS is used within over 1,400 critical US defense system applications, GENESIS can bridge the gap between generative AI agent capabilities and a true integration with operational defense systems; however, there are still challenges with rapid incorporation of agents into the framework, which are required to keep pace with the extreme pace of generative AI advancements.
  
Figure 1. Working closely with PEO Digital and CMSO, we have defined the GENESIS Distributed Agent Architecture.  GENESIS is a first of its kind solution to enable agent solutions to discover each other and collectively & securely work together.

We have identified and elaborate on three key challenges below that a solution like GENESIS will need to support related to rapid integration: 

Challenge 1 [C1]: Ensuring Isolated and Secure Testing Environments
Testing AI agents in isolated and secure environments is critical to ensure that new or updated agents do not adversely affect live operational systems during development and testing phases. The isolated testing environments must effectively mirror real operational conditions to ensure that agents can be accurately evaluated without risks. This isolation also prevents accidental leaks of sensitive data or unintended interactions that could compromise operational security or integrity.
Impact
Risk Management: Allows testing of experimental or developmental agents without the risk of affecting real-world operations.
Data Integrity: Ensures that live data is not corrupted or misused during the testing phases.
Development Velocity: Speeds up the development process by allowing for more aggressive testing schedules without fear of impacting operational systems.
Challenge 2 [C2]: Efficient Integration of AI Agents with Existing Systems
Integrating AI agents efficiently with existing systems and infrastructures poses a significant challenge, particularly in environments governed by stringent operational protocols and legacy systems. The integration process must be seamless and must not require extensive reconfiguration of the existing systems. This requires standardized interfaces and robust API support to facilitate communication and data exchange between AI agents and legacy systems.

Impact
Operational Continuity: Ensures that the addition of new AI capabilities does not disrupt existing operations.
Scalability: Allows for the addition of more agents as needed without a proportional increase in integration overhead.
Flexibility: Supports the incorporation of agents developed using different technologies or frameworks, enhancing the system’s adaptability.

Challenge 3 [C3]: Streamlined Deployment and Management of AI Agents
Once AI agents are developed and integrated, they need to be deployed and managed efficiently to ensure they perform as expected and can be easily updated or rolled back if issues arise. This challenge involves developing tools and processes for managing the lifecycle of AI agents, including deployment automation, version control, and performance monitoring. These tools must support rapid deployment and easy management to keep pace with the operational demands and evolving threat landscapes.

Impact
Operational Agility: Enables DAF to quickly adapt to new information or changing tactical situations by rapidly deploying updated AI agents.
Maintainability: Simplifies the management of AI agents, including updates and rollbacks, ensuring that systems can be maintained with minimal downtime.
Reliability: Increases the reliability of AI-driven systems by ensuring that only thoroughly tested and approved agents are deployed into operational settings.

We identified the following set of high-level requirements that, if addressed, will ensure the GENESIS framework can effectively support the integration and operational deployment of generative AI agents in a manner that is safe, secure, reliable, and efficient. They form the basis of our proposal to design and develop a robust, scalable, and interoperable multi-agent system that leverages the strengths of the DDS communication layer, enhanced with advanced security and management features to meet the specific needs of military simulations and operations.
R1.	Ensuring Isolated and Secure Testing Environments: Create isolated testing environments that allow for secure, scenario-based testing without impacting live operational data or system performance.
R2.	Efficient Integration of AI Agents with Existing Systems: Develop a mechanism that ensures AI agents can be integrated smoothly and efficiently with existing systems and infrastructures without extensive custom development.
R3.	Streamlined Deployment and Management of AI Agents: Facilitate the deployment and management of AI agents to ensure they can be quickly and reliably rolled out into live environments and efficiently updated or rolled back if necessary.
 
2	Phase I Effort
2.1	High-Level Summary
The specific objectives of the Phase I work are designed to establish the feasibility of the proposed GENESIS Toolkit and to set the foundation for subsequent development phases. These objectives include detailed tasks and associated questions that the research and development effort will address.
Figure 2 is a conceptual architecture depicting the proposed scope for the Phase I effort.  The middle and right boxes showing the integration of Simulink and flight simulators (ROS is used as an example) are supported today by Mathworks.  The left box highlights the GENESIS additions.  
Our focus will be on enabling Simulink applications to discover and securely interact with remote LLM agents over DDS.    highlights functionality for the Simulink applications to discover agents.   highlights functionality to enable these applications to interact with the LLM agents to support their planning and decision-making needs.   highlights functionality that will allow the agents themselves to discover and interact with each other.  When new agents are added to GENESIS, they will manually(initially) / automatically (later) register with the Agent Service.  Registration data will include descriptions of the services provided by the agents.  This will enable the Simulink applications to search for custom agents for specific tasking, such as path planning.
We will integrate some initial LLM agents and an example UAV path optimization application (leveraging the Simulink UAV Toolbox) to test our design and interfaces.  This will also be used as a Getting Started Guide for users of GENESIS.  We will make the framework available to any other interested awardees for use in Phase I (as noted earlier, using some initial limited funding from our current DAF Phase II effort, and free licenses from Mathworks, we are already working on an early prototype).  We will seek out feedback so that we can continue to improve the framework and iteratively provide updated versions during the Phase I.  The four objectives of our Phase I effort are described in the following subsections.

 
Figure 2. The GENESIS Simulink Toolkit will provide a modular, scalable, secure, and resilient solution to enable the rapid integration of generative AI technologies into Simulink, enabling them to discover each other and effectively collaborate in support of advanced USAF mission simulation needs.

4	Phase I Work Plan Outline
In Phase I, RTI is focusing on stakeholder engagement, requirements identification, software design and implementation.  We are actively engaging with our stakeholders, focusing on gathering and evaluating any additional requirements, and incorporate them into our software architecture process.  We will use agile development processes with iterative spirals to rapidly derisk and standard software development processes to ensure the quality of the generated products.
The main goal of stakeholder involvement in this project is to provide government representation, subject matter expertise, requirements, metrics for evaluation of the developed capability, and if successful, to facilitate the adoption and transition of this capability into the Air Force.  We may eventually need program specific security clearances to support the integration of our technology.
The output of our Phase I will include progress reports and a final report with an SF298.
 
Figure 3. Prior to this proposal, RTI has developed important pieces of our GENESIS framework vision by leveraging both SBIR and IRAD funds. Our objective is to continue this effort in Phase I, and then pursue standardization (via the OMG international standards body) and transition with our close partners at MathWorks.

5	Phase I Summary

5.1.1.1	5.1 Summary of Effort
During the six-month Base Period RTI confirmed the feasibility of the GENESIS Agent Toolkit for Simulink and demonstrated two progressively richer prototypes (v0.1 and v0.2).  Work followed an agile, spiral cadence mapped to four objectives:

Obj.	Focus	Representative Results
1	Stakeholder-driven requirements & architecture	• Bi-weekly triage with PEO Digital, AFRL MS&A and fellow awardees  
• Initial design of a modular, DDS-based toolkit that external teams could clone and run in < 15 min.
2	Core integration services	• Extended Agent Integration API supporting OpenAI, Anthropic & LangChain agents  
• Fully-distributed Agent & Service Registry able to track ≥ 5 agents without a central server  
• Prototype memory service with list-based and Knowledge-Graph (GraphRAG) modes
3	Testing & documentation	> 250 unit/integration tests, automated CI scripts 
> 15 Markdown guides (setup, API, monitoring, security)
4	Integration & feedback	• Multi-site digital-twin demo: Simulink UAV toolbox ⇄ GENESIS agents ⇄ RTI DDS ⇄ ArduPilot Mission-Planner  
• Live network monitor and web dashboards adopted by other performers

Collectively these activities de-risked discovery, control and monitoring of heterogeneous LLM-based agents inside a DDS ecosystem and validated bidirectional connectivity with the simulation tool-chain.

 
5.1.1.2	5.2 Key Takeaways / Lessons Learned
1.	Distributed beats centralized. Migrating the registry to a DDS topic eliminated a single-point-of-failure.
2.	“Wrapper” integration pattern is critical. Teams want to drop in pre-existing agents; the planned GenesisWrapper (zero-code DDS adapter) is the most requested feature.
3.	GraphRAG is promising but not one-size-fits-all. Hybrid (graph + embedding) retrieval yields richer situational queries, yet can add latency for time-critical control loops—tuning profiles per user role is essential.
4.	Early, frequent demos drive alignment. The joint UAV survey scenario forced harmonized message schemas and uncovered edge cases (unit slang, mixed-unit conversions, etc.) long before Phase II.
5.	Security must move from “conceptual” to “configured.” Stakeholders view DDS Transport Security as mandatory for any operational pilot; certificate provisioning and policy templates must be produced next.

 
5.1.1.3	5.3 Innovations Achieved
•	Self-organizing agent network (GENESIS v0.2) — agents, services and interfaces advertise themselves and form peer-to-peer RPC meshes automatically.
•	Dynamic function-classification pipeline — two-stage LLM filter that selects the minimal context window before invoking high-cost models.
•	Live DDS topology visualizer — real-time graph showing GUID-level links, QoS and health, usable for both debugging and operator awareness.
•	Digital-twin prediction layer — side-by-side “Real World / Predicted” maps driven entirely by DDS streams; supports what-if validation before executing flight plans.
•	Cross-domain bridge kit — reference MAVLink-DDS adaptor proving GENESIS can command legacy simulators without refactoring their code.

 
5.1.1.4	5.4 Next Steps (Phase II Road-Map)
Planned Activity	Desired Outcome
Harden GenesisWrapper & publish template generator / CLI	Plug-and-play onboarding for 3rd-party agents in < 5 min
Implement full DDS Security with canned CA & permissions examples	ATO-ready baseline; aligns with Zero-Trust mandates
Add asynchronous function orchestration & retry/circuit-breaker helpers	Reliable long-running task execution and graceful degradation
Release v1.0 GENESIS Toolkit (GUI installer, docs, sample sims)	Enable wider USAF/industry pilot adoption
Pursue OMG standardization draft for Agent-to-Agent DDS profiles	Ensure openness, interoperability and future vendor neutrality
Integrate with cloud-based agent and tool protocols.	Ensure integration with industry standard protocols such as A2A, AgentIQ, and MCP.
Integrate with a robust commercial and DOD simulation environment.	Integrate with AFSIM and NVIDIA Omniverse. Strengthen our already existing partnerships with the Air Force and NVIDIA.

These steps position GENESIS to transition from a successful feasibility prototype to an operationally deployable, standards-track capability that lets the Department of the Air Force field secure, large-scale AI agent swarms inside mission simulations and, ultimately, real-world systems.




 
6	Phase I – Task Summaries
6.1	Task 1: Requirements Gathering and System Design 
This task focused on the initial engagement with the stakeholders for other PEO digital awardees.  We meet by weekly as a group to discuss current project status and cross project engagement.  These meetings have refined out focus to a March joint demo with other awardees to plan and execute an autonomous arial survey planed by AI through GENESIS.  Our efforts prior to this focus have been sharing how each project could complement each other.  

Task 1.1: We have shared the design and API documentation within the larger group as well as provided a full simulation demonstration to the group to show how GENEISIS functions and its capabilities within a DDS enabled simulation environment

Task 1.2: We meet biweekly and incorporate other’s progress and objectives into our architecture.  These new specifications are now in the design of GENESIS as well as driving our interfaces for rapid use of GENESIS, which is the focus of this effort.

Task 1.3: We meet biweekly with PEO digital and other stakeholders.  

Task 1.4: Interfaces, a complex simulation, and the overall GENESIS Architecture were designed to meet PEO digital requirements and target demonstration of a “tower” communicating with a human and/or AI controlled aircraft.  Details are in the appendix.


6.2	Task 2: Spiral Development of Core Integration Services 
Task 2.1: The API has been revised based on the learnings from our interactions with the team as well as development of the prototypes and demos.  In the most current version of our prototype, we implemented a fully distributed, self-organizing agent to agent framework.  We demonstrate that any python agent, from any framework can be integrated into the GENESIS environment and implement the following:

1.	Multiple Agent Types Implementation:
•	SimpleOpenAIGenesisAgent: A minimal implementation providing a clean interface for OpenAI integration
•	OpenAIGenesisAgent: A more sophisticated agent with function calling capabilities
•	OpenAIFunctionAgent: Specialized agent for handling OpenAI function calls
•	GenesisAnthropicChatAgent: Integration with Anthropic's Claude model
2.	Robust Integration Framework:
•	The project implements a base GenesisAgent class that provides core functionality for all agents
•	Uses RTI Connext DDS for robust communication between agents
•	Implements a monitored interface system for tracking agent connections and interactions
3.	Function Discovery and Classification:
•	Agents can discover available functions in the system
•	Includes a FunctionClassifier to determine which functions are relevant for specific queries
•	Supports dynamic function registration and discovery
4.	Seamless Communication:
•	Implements a request-reply pattern for agent communication
•	Uses standardized message formats for requests and responses
•	Supports conversation history management
•	Includes event tracking and monitoring capabilities
5.	Advanced Features:
•	Support for function calling capabilities
•	Chain event tracking for monitoring agent interactions
•	Robust error handling and logging
•	Configurable system prompts and model selection
•	Support for multiple conversation contexts
6.	Security and Configuration:
•	Proper API key management through environment variables
•	Configurable model parameters
•	Secure function execution handling
The implementation shows a working prototype that successfully integrates external AI agents
 (like OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude) into the GENESIS framework, with proper monitoring, function discovery, and communication capabilities. The code demonstrates a well-structured and extensible system that can support multiple types of AI agents working together within the framework.


Task 2.2: Two versions of the service registry were completed in the first status update, one that is a backend server and one that incorporates a direct frontend react management interface.  We set out to explore a fully distributed service registry (Fully distributed throughout the Genesis Network for 1-n agents/functions/interfaces).  We not only found that this is a viable approach but accomplishes the goal of simplifying genesis for agent developers.  We now have a version 0.2 of the Genesis Network which is entirely fully distributed.  Some highlights of the Genesis network functionality are listed below:

1.	Core Registry Implementation:
•	FunctionRegistry class in genesis_lib/function_discovery.py that serves as the central registry for managing agents and services
•	Supports DDS-based distributed function discovery and execution
•	Tracks different types of function providers:
•	Other agents with specific expertise
•	Traditional ML models wrapped as function providers
•	Planning agents for complex task decomposition

Task 2.3: Memory management was implemented in V0.1 of GENESIS.  The memory management approach follows the OpenAI standard of an array of messages.  In addition to this work, we explored the use of knowledge graphs for memory management.  We found that the OpenAI standard is straightforward in its implementation in GENESIS.  While it is not V0.2 yet, the work will continue.  The most interesting memory management was though the use Knowledge Graphs.  A short description is detailed below:

	We explored the application of GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) for semantic analysis of UAV data, combining knowledge graphs with large language models to translate complex spatiotemporal data into meaningful insights. We implemented multiple approaches with increasing sophistication—from basic Chain of Thought to robust, embedding-enhanced systems—and found that while simpler methods handled basic entity queries adequately, multi-step validated approaches were required for complex pattern recognition and relationship analysis across temporal data.

The motivation for this effort stemmed from a fundamental challenge in analyzing system data in real-time. In UAV systems, this means transforming raw sensor and positional data into actionable intelligence. Traditional database approaches struggle with complex temporal patterns and semantic relationships. Knowledge graphs, on the other hand, excel at representing temporal sequences and explicit relationships, making them ideal for tracking entity states over time, detecting complex patterns, and potentially identifying anomalous behaviors. Our approach leverages this temporal strength by modeling UAV positions as sequential state nodes with timestamp properties, enabling sophisticated queries that can detect patterns such as UAV movements over time, analyze sensor data, and correlate sensor activities across time windows. Our goal was to explore whether this temporal reasoning capability enables valuable insights it would otherwise be hard to generate.

The high-level conclusions from our research highlight both the promise and limitations of current GraphRAG techniques. While knowledge graphs provide exceptional capability for explicit relationship modeling and temporal analysis, they remain fundamentally binary in their representation—information is either explicitly present or absent. We found that embedding semantics (combining traditional RAG with GraphRAG) created a better hybrid approach that could capture implicit relationships and similarities between entities based on their behavioral patterns. This is particularly important for operational contexts where analysts need to identify "similar but not identical" threat patterns based on limited historical examples. Our experiments confirmed that different user roles require specialized GraphRAG configurations—the embedding-enhanced approaches that benefit intelligence analysts performing deep pattern analysis may introduce unnecessary latency for field operators requiring immediate situational awareness. The project ultimately demonstrates that GraphRAG is not a universal solution but rather a powerful analytical approach that must be carefully configured for specific operational contexts and user needs.

6.3	Task 3: Spiral Testing and Documentation

Task 3.1: We conducted internal testing of integration services to ensure they meet the functional requirements.  These tests evolved from individual tests to full unit tests as development progressed in V0.2 (Fully distributed) of GENESIS.  Well, the testing code is quite extensive, here is a brief summary of the testing framework for services to demonstrate how testing is managed within GENESIS.

1.	Centralized Test Framework
•	The project has a main test orchestrator (test_all_services.py) that coordinates testing of all integration services
•	It uses the AllServicesTest class to systematically test each service's functionality
2.	Service-Specific Tests
•	Individual test implementations for different services:
•	Calculator Service
•	Letter Counter Service
•	Text Processor Service
•	Drone Service
3.	Test Coverage Areas:
•	Functional Testing: Tests verify that each service's functions work as expected
•	Integration Testing: Tests ensure services can communicate and work together
•	Performance Testing: Includes performance tests (e.g., test_calculator_performance()) to verify service responsiveness
•	Error Handling: Tests include error cases and proper error reporting
4.	Test Infrastructure:
•	Uses a GenericFunctionClient for standardized service interaction

•	Results are logged and can be monitored in real-time
•	Test output is stored in log files for later analysis
Here's an example of how a typical test is structured:
python
async def test_calculator_service(self):
    """Test the calculator service"""
    logger.info("===== Testing Calculator Service =====")
    
    try:
        # Test specific function
        result = await self.client.call_function_by_name("add", x=10, y=5)
        self.test_results.append({
            "service": "CalculatorService",
            "function": "add",
            "args": {"x": 10, "y": 5},
            "result": result,
            "success": True
        })
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling and logging
        self.test_results.append({
            "service": "CalculatorService",
            "function": "add",
            "error": str(e),
            "success": False
        })

1.	Providing systematic testing of all integration services
2.	Verifying functional requirements through specific test cases
3.	Including error handling and validation
4.	Maintaining test results and logs for verification
5.	Supporting automated test execution
6.	Enabling continuous integration testing through shell scripts

7	Appendices (Task Detailed Updates)


7.1	GENESIS Architecture v0.2 Fully Distributed (Appendix A)
7.1.1	Overview
GENESIS (Gen-AI Network for Enhanced Simulation Integrations and Security) is a Python library designed for building complex, distributed AI agent networks. It facilitates seamless communication, dynamic function discovery, and collaboration between heterogeneous AI agents, leveraging the power of RTI Connext DDS for real-time, reliable, and scalable interactions.

The core purpose of GENESIS is to enable the creation of sophisticated multi-agent systems where different agents, potentially built using various AI frameworks (like LangChain, OpenAI's API, or native Python), can work together to solve problems that are beyond the capability of any single agent.
7.1.2	Why an Agent-to-Agent Framework like GENESIS?
Modern AI applications often require the coordination of multiple specialized components:


•	LLMs: For natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning.
•	Planning Agents: To decompose complex tasks.
•	Perception Models: To interpret sensory data.
•	Domain-Specific Tools: Databases, simulators, external APIs.

Connecting these components ad-hoc using simple methods like direct sockets or basic REST APIs quickly becomes complex and brittle. Key challenges include:


1.	Discovery: How do agents find each other and the capabilities they offer?
2.	Reliability: How to ensure messages are delivered, especially in dynamic or unreliable networks?
3.	Scalability: How to handle communication efficiently as the number of agents and interactions grows?
4.	Data Typing: How to ensure data consistency between different agents?
5.	Real-time Needs: How to support low-latency interactions required for certain applications?
6.	Heterogeneity: How to integrate agents built with different technologies or frameworks?

GENESIS addresses these challenges by providing a structured framework built on DDS.
7.1.3	Philosophy: Automated Agent Connection
GENESIS is built on the philosophy that agent networks should be self-organizing and self-configuring. Rather than requiring users to manually define connections between agents, GENESIS automates the entire process of agent discovery, connection, and collaboration.
7.1.3.1	Key Principles
1.	Zero-Configuration Discovery: Agents automatically discover each other through DDS without manual configuration of IPs/ports, adapting dynamically.
2.	Self-Organizing Networks: Connections form based on capabilities, allowing network topology to emerge organically without central orchestration.
3.	Intelligent Function Matching: Functions are classified and matched to requests dynamically, enabling agents to use newly available capabilities.
4.	Automatic Load Balancing: Multiple instances of functions are discovered, allowing requests to be distributed, adapting to provider availability.
7.1.3.2	Genesis Wrapper: Seamless Integration
A key component of this automation philosophy is the planned Genesis Wrapper system. This system will allow existing agents to be integrated into Genesis without any code changes.
 

How it Works:


1.	Input/Output Capture: Monitors agent streams to capture calls/responses.
2.	Automatic Integration: Handles all DDS communication transparently.
3.	Schema Generation: Analyzes I/O patterns to create DDS types and function descriptions.
4.	Monitoring Integration: Adds health/performance tracking automatically.

Example Usage (Conceptual):

# Example of wrapping an existing agent (Conceptual)
from genesis_lib import GenesisWrapper

# Create wrapper for existing agent
wrapper = GenesisWrapper(
    agent=existing_agent,
    input_method="process_input",  # Method to capture inputs
    output_method="get_response",  # Method to capture outputs
    name="wrapped_agent"           # Name in Genesis network
)

# Start the wrapped agent
wrapper.start()
# Agent is now discoverable and usable within the Genesis network.

Benefits:


•	Zero-Code Integration: Integrates legacy or existing systems quickly.
•	Automatic Discovery: Wrapped agents join and advertise functions seamlessly.
•	Seamless Operation: Preserves original agent behavior.
•	Enhanced Capabilities: Gains monitoring, load balancing potential, etc.

This wrapper system exemplifies Genesis's commitment to automation and ease of use.
7.1.4	Example: Automated Connection Flow
 
7.1.5	Benefits of Automation
1.	Reduced Complexity: Eliminates manual connection management.
2.	Increased Reliability: Automatic discovery and potential for reconnection.
3.	Enhanced Scalability: Easily add/remove agents and functions.
4.	Improved Flexibility: Adapt to changing requirements and network topology.
7.2	System Architecture
GENESIS employs a modular architecture built upon RTI Connext DDS.
 
 

7.2.1	Key Components:


•	GenesisApp: Foundational base class for DDS setup (Participant, Topics).
•	GenesisAgent / MonitoredAgent: Base classes for autonomous agents. MonitoredAgent adds automatic lifecycle/status reporting. Hosts FunctionRegistry, FunctionClassifier, RPCClient.
•	GenesisInterface / MonitoredInterface: Specialized agents for entry/exit points (UIs, bridges).
•	GenesisRPCService: Base class for discoverable function providers (services). Handles registration and request processing.
•	GenesisRPCClient: Base class for clients interacting with RPC services.
•	Function Registry (FunctionRegistry): Discovers FunctionCapability announcements via DDS and maintains a local cache. Resides within agents.
•	Function Classifier/Matcher (FunctionClassifier, FunctionMatcher): Components (often within agents) to intelligently select functions, potentially using LLMs.
•	Monitoring System (genesis_monitoring.py, genesis_web_monitor.py): Standalone applications subscribing to DDS monitoring topics for observation.
•	DDS Communication Layer: RTI Connext DDS providing transport for discovery, RPC, and monitoring.

7.2.2	Interaction Flow:


1.	Agents/Services start, initialize DDS, begin discovery.
2.	Services (GenesisRPCService) publish FunctionCapability via DDS.
3.	Agents (GenesisAgent) discover capabilities via their FunctionRegistry.
4.	An Interface (GenesisInterface) or Agent receives input/task.
5.	The agent uses its FunctionRegistry, FunctionClassifier, and FunctionMatcher to identify needed functions.
6.	The RPCClient sends requests over DDS RPC topics if remote functions are needed.
7.	The target RPCService receives the request, executes, and sends a reply via DDS.
8.	MonitoredAgent/MonitoredInterface publish lifecycle, status, and log events to DDS Monitoring Topics.
9.	The Monitoring System subscribes to provide visibility.
7.2.3	Internal Communication Identifiers
GENESIS components are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) automatically assigned by DDS (e.g., 0101f2a4a246e5cf70e2629680000002). These GUIDs enable precise targeting and tracking:


•	Discovery: Genesis logs GUIDs upon discovery:

FunctionCapability subscription matched with remote GUID: 0101f2a4a246e5cf70e2629680000002
FunctionCapability subscription matched with self GUID:   010193af524e12b65bd4c08980000002


•	Function Association: Provider-client relationships are logged:

DEBUG: CLIENT side processing function_id=569fb375-1c98-40c7-ac12-c6f8ae9b3854,
       provider=0101f2a4a246e5cf70e2629680000002,
       client=010193af524e12b65bd4c08980000002


•	Benefits: Unambiguous identification, availability tracking, clear function provider association, potential for identity-based access control.
7.3	Key Features & "Special Sauce"
•	DDS-Powered Communication: Utilizes RTI Connext DDS for:


•	Publish/Subscribe: For discovery (FunctionCapability, genesis_agent_registration_announce), monitoring (MonitoringEvent, etc.), and data streaming.
•	Request/Reply (RPC): For reliable remote procedure calls (FunctionExecutionRequest/Reply).
•	Automatic Discovery: Built-in mechanism for agents/services to find each other.
•	Quality of Service (QoS): Fine-grained control (reliability, durability, latency, etc.) configurable via XML profiles for different topics (e.g., reliable/durable discovery, reliable/volatile RPC, best-effort monitoring).
•	Real-time Performance: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput.
•	Platform Independence: Supports various platforms (Genesis focuses on Python).


•	DDS Network Transport and Protocol Details: GENESIS leverages DDS's transport agnostic flexibility:


•	UDPv4/UDPv6: Default for LAN/WAN, efficient multicast discovery, configurable RTPS reliability (heartbeats, ACKs).
•	Shared Memory: Automatic zero-copy transport for inter-process communication on the same host (μs latency, high throughput).
•	TCP: Option for WANs or firewall traversal (port 7400, configurable), supports TLS.
•	Automatic Selection: DDS chooses the best transport based on endpoint location (SHMEM -> UDP -> TCP).
•	Network Usage: Efficient CDR serialization, configurable batching, predictable discovery traffic overhead.


•	Dynamic Function Discovery & Injection:


•	Agents advertise Functions (FunctionCapability topic) with standardized schemas.
•	Agents discover functions dynamically at runtime (function_discovery.py).
•	Optional LLM-based two-stage classification (agent_function_injection.md) to quickly identify relevant functions before deeper processing.
•	Discovered functions can be automatically "injected" into LLM prompts/contexts.


•	LLM Integration and AI Framework Support:


•	Native Integrations: Direct API support for OpenAI (GPT series), Anthropic (Claude series), and integration capabilities for Llama, Mistral, HuggingFace models (via local inference or API).
•	Optimized LLM Usage:
o	Two-Stage Function Processing: Use lightweight LLMs for initial classification and powerful LLMs for execution/reasoning.
o	Context Window Management: Automatic token counting, truncation strategies, dynamic compression.
o	Hybrid Inference: Combine local and remote models, potentially routing based on task complexity or cost.
•	AI Framework Compatibility: Adapters and integrations planned/available for LangChain, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace Transformers. Custom agents integrated via the GenesisWrapper. Example LangChain integration:

from genesis_lib.adapters import LangChainGenesisAdapter
# ... LangChain agent setup ...
genesis_agent = LangChainGenesisAdapter(
    agent_executor=executor, name="math_agent", description="Solves math problems",
    register_tools_as_functions=True # Expose LangChain tools as Genesis functions
)
await genesis_agent.run() # Agent joins Genesis network


•	Deployment Options: Supports Cloud APIs, Local Inference (ggml, ONNX, llama.cpp), Self-hosted APIs (TGI, vLLM), Hybrid, and Containerized deployments.


•	Agent-Framework Agnostic: Designed to integrate agents regardless of implementation (Python/DDS required). Base classes provided, GenesisWrapper planned for zero-code integration.


•	Built-in Monitoring: MonitoredAgent publishes lifecycle, communication, status, and log events (ComponentLifecycleEvent, ChainEvent, MonitoringEvent, LivelinessUpdate, LogMessage) over DDS. Monitoring tools (genesis_monitor.py, genesis_web_monitor.py) provide visibility.


•	Structured RPC Framework: Base classes (GenesisRPCService, GenesisRPCClient) for robust RPC with schema validation (jsonschema), error handling, and request/reply management.

7.5	Core Concepts & Technical Details
Configuration Management
•	DDS Configuration (XML): Primary method via QoS Profiles XML files defining QoS, resource limits, transports, discovery peers, and optionally types (datamodel.xml). Loaded by GenesisApp.
•	Application Configuration: Environment Variables (NDDSHOME, API keys), Config Files (YAML, .env using python-dotenv, etc.), Command-line Arguments.
•	Genesis Component Configuration: Constructor arguments, programmatic settings within the code.
7.6	State Management
GENESIS is flexible; state is managed at the agent/service level:


•	Agent Internal State: Managed within Python class instances (e.g., conversation history).
•	Stateless Functions: RPC Services often designed stateless for scalability.
•	DDS for Shared State (Durability): DDS Durability QoS (TRANSIENT_LOCAL, PERSISTENT) can share state (e.g., FunctionCapability, shared world model) across agents or with late joiners.
•	External Databases/Stores: Agents can integrate with external DBs for complex persistence.
7.7	Error Handling and Resilience
Combines DDS features and application logic:


•	DDS Reliability QoS: RELIABLE QoS handles transient network issues via retransmissions.
•	DDS Liveliness QoS: Detects unresponsive components via heartbeats, notifying participants. LivelinessUpdate topic provides visibility.
•	Timeouts: Configurable in GenesisRPCClient, DDS WaitSets, and DDS request-reply operations.
•	Deadlines: DDS Deadline QoS ensures periodic data flow.
•	Application-Level Handling: RPC replies include success/error_message. Use try...except blocks. Consider Circuit Breakers.
•	Redundancy: Multiple instances of services provide failover; DDS discovery finds all instances.
•	Monitoring: Helps identify failures via lifecycle events and logs.

7.8	DDS Security and Access Control (DDS Native, not yet applied in GENESIS)
Leverages RTI Connext DDS Security for enterprise-grade protection:


•	Plugins: Implements Authentication (X.509 certificates), Access Control (permissions documents), Encryption (AES-GCM), and Logging.

<!-- Example Security Config Snippet -->
<property>
    <value>
      <element>
        <name>dds.sec.auth.identity_ca</name>
        <value>file:///path/to/identity_ca.pem</value>
      </element>
      <!-- Other security properties: cert, key, permissions, governance -->
    </value>
</property>


•	Isolation: DDS Domains provide network isolation. Secure Partitions and Topic-level rules offer finer control.
•	Fine-Grained Access Control: Role-based, group-based policies defined in XML permissions files.

<!-- Example Permissions Snippet -->
<permissions>
  <grant name="AgentRole_A">
    <subject_name>CN=SpecificAgent,O=MyOrg</subject_name>
    <allow_rule>
      <publish><topics><topic>CriticalData</topic></topics></publish>
      <subscribe><topics><topic>GeneralStatus</topic></topics></subscribe>
    </allow_rule>
  </grant>
</permissions>


•	Semantic Security Guardrails: (Conceptual/Future) Middleware to monitor conversations and function calls for exploits, policy violations, or harmful content, complementing DDS transport security. Specialized components like SemanticGuardian could perform content analysis, enforce boundaries, validate I/O, and maintain adaptive trust scores. RTI aims to provide APIs for third-party integration here.
•	Benefits: Zero Trust Architecture, Compliance readiness, Defense in Depth, Secure Multi-Tenancy, Centralized Management.
7.9	Performance Characteristics
Performance depends on DDS and application logic.


•	Latency: DDS enables sub-millisecond latency (esp. SHMEM/UDP). Influenced by network, serialization, LLM inference, agent logic.
•	Throughput: DDS supports high throughput (millions msg/sec). Depends on message size, participants, processing, QoS.
•	Scalability: DDS scales to hundreds/thousands of participants. Function discovery scales with two-stage classification. Limited by network/discovery traffic.
•	Resource Usage: DDS resource usage configurable via QoS. Python usage depends on agent complexity.
7.10	Lifelong Learning Through Dynamic Chaining (Future)
Genesis's dynamic function discovery and potential for automated chaining lay groundwork for lifelong learning systems. Agents can adapt and improve over time.
7.10.1	Lifelong Learning Components (Conceptual)
 
7.10.2	Core Ideas:


1.	Experience Collection: Record which function chains were used, their inputs, outputs, and performance metrics.

# Conceptual Experience Collector
class ExperienceCollector:
    def record_chain_execution(self, chain_details, result, metrics):
        # Store experience data (e.g., in memory, DB, or DDS topic)
        pass


2.	Chain Evolution/Optimization: Use collected experiences (potentially with RL or other optimization techniques) to refine how chains are constructed or selected for future tasks.

# Conceptual Chain Evolution
class ChainEvolution:
    def evolve_chain(self, query, context, historical_data):
        # Generate candidate chains, evaluate based on history, optimize selection
        pass

Features Enabled:


•	Knowledge Accumulation: Learn from successes/failures, adapt to context.
•	Transfer Learning: Share effective patterns between agents or tasks.
•	Adaptive Optimization: Refine function selection, prompts, or strategies.
•	System Evolution: Improve overall system performance over time.

Benefits: Continuous improvement, knowledge preservation, adaptive intelligence, scalable learning across the network. This transforms Genesis from a static framework to potentially dynamic, evolving systems.
7.11	Deployment and Operations
•	Environments: Containers (Docker - manage network/license access), VMs/Bare Metal, Cloud (configure security groups for DDS ports).
•	DDS Configuration: Manage via XML QoS Profiles. Set NDDSHOME environment variable.
•	Networking: Ensure firewalls allow DDS discovery (UDP multicast/unicast) and data traffic (UDP/TCP ports). Choose appropriate transports.
•	Monitoring: Use Genesis tools (genesis_monitor.py, web monitor) and RTI Tools (Admin Console, Monitor) for DDS-level inspection. Aggregate logs via LogMessage topic or standard logging.
•	Operations: Graceful shutdown is important. Manage updates carefully (especially type changes - consider DDS X-Types). Scaling involves adding/removing instances (DDS handles discovery). Load balancing may need custom logic.
7.12	Debugging and Troubleshooting
•	Genesis Monitoring: High-level visibility via monitoring topics.
•	Python Debugging: Standard tools (pdb, IDEs) for single-component logic.
•	Logging: Crucial. Use built-in LogMessage topic for aggregation. Check Python and DDS log levels. Example log line indicating an issue:

2025-04-08 08:47:37,710 - FunctionCapabilityListener.4418720944 - ERROR - Error processing function capability: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable


•	RTI DDS Tools: Admin Console (visualize network, participants, topics, QoS mismatches), Monitor (performance metrics), Wireshark (DDS dissector).
•	Common Issues:
o	Discovery: Domain IDs, firewall blocks, type consistency (datamodel.xml). Check Admin Console.
o	Communication: Topic names, QoS compatibility (check Admin Console), serialization errors.
o	Performance: Use RTI Monitor, profiling. Check QoS settings.
o	Resource Limits: DDS entity creation failures (check logs/Admin Console).
o	Type Errors: Debug data processing logic (like the log example above).
o	Timeouts: Check DDS/application timeout settings if requests fail. Example log:

ERROR - Unexpected error in service: Timed out waiting for requests
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Genesis-LIB/genesis_lib/rpc_service.py", line 140, in run
    requests = self.replier.receive_requests(max_wait=dds.Duration(3600))


•	Strategy: Correlate information from application logs, Genesis monitoring, and RTI DDS tools.

7.13	Future Development & Next Steps (Addressing Limitations)
Key areas for enhancement:


•	Function Chaining & Composition: Standardized mechanisms for multi-step workflows.
•	Asynchronous Function Execution: Better support for long-running tasks (callbacks, async RPC).
•	Enhanced Web Interface: More features for monitoring, interaction, configuration.
•	Advanced Security Implementation: Fully implement DDS Security features with examples.
•	Performance Optimizations: Benchmarking, caching, serialization improvements (FlatBuffers/Protobuf?), QoS tuning.
•	Distributed Memory/State Management: Tools/patterns for sophisticated shared state beyond basic DDS durability.
•	Expanded Agent Integrations: More adapters (LangChain, AutoGen), finalize GenesisWrapper.
•	Load Balancing: Standardized client-side or dedicated load balancing strategies.
•	Comprehensive Documentation & Tutorials: More examples, use cases (security, deployment).
•	Error Recovery Frameworks: Standard patterns for circuit breakers, graceful degradation.
•	Standardized Metrics Collection: Define comprehensive metrics for analysis.

Our demonstration of GENESIS was constrained by the need to demonstrate through MS Teams remotely.  As GENESIS is a fully distributed environment, the design allows for independent component construction and deployment without need to reconfigure other components.  This flexibility is highly desirable but results in an environment that consists of multiple applications multiple applications, distributed across 5 systems (2 cloud and 3 local) in 3 different geographical locations (AWS-East, Colorado, California).  For this second demonstration we were able to combine interfaces into a single web environment for many of the instrumentation examples.  This reduced the number of videos to be taken to 3, in which we combined to show the full capability of Genesis.

8.1	GENESIS Demo Description
This demo showcases the capabilities of the GENESIS framework, a distributed AI agent system built on RTI Connext DDS. It highlights natural language interaction, multi-agent coordination, digital twin concepts, system monitoring, and integration with existing external systems.

Scene 1: Control Center Interaction & Initial Queries (00:00 - 00:31)


•	 (00:00) The demo opens with the "Control Center" interface. This is a GenesisInterface component. It features:
o	A command history/log panel (top left).
o	A text input field for natural language commands (middle left).
o	An "Execute Plan" button (below input).
o	A "Prediction Map" panel (bottom left, initially showing "Digital Twin").
o	A 3D map visualization (top right).
o	A 2D map visualization (bottom right, also initially labeled "Digital Twin").
o	DDS topic indicators for different drone types (colored squares, top right of 3D map).
•	 (00:01 - 00:16) The user types the first command: "How many birds are mission-capable?" and hits Send. The system (a primary GenesisAgent) processes the query. It understands "birds" is likely slang for "drones" in this context and responds, correcting the terminology: "All the drones listed are quadcopters, not birds... there are 9 mission-capable drones in this list." This demonstrates natural language understanding and access to system state (likely via a Function Service providing drone status). The response also confirms the drones appear operational based on their reported data (positions, headings, etc.).
•	 (00:16 - 00:31) The user issues a second query: "Report current angels in meters for each bird." The agent processes this. It understands "angels" as altitude (likely in feet, based on common aviation slang) and "bird" as drone. It retrieves the altitude (initially near 0 feet, converting to approx -0.006 meters, indicating ground level or slight sensor variation) and reports it back, explicitly showing the conversion: Altitude = -0.019685040 feet = -0.006 meters. This again shows NLU, unit conversion, and state retrieval capabilities. The 2D map label changes to "Real World (Simulated)" (Timestamp: 00:30), clarifying its role as representing the current simulated physical state.























Scene 2: Tasking, Prediction, and Execution (00:31 - 01:53)


•	 (00:31 - 01:09) The user issues a command: "all units cleared. take off to angels five-zero".  The agent processes the command, confirms "Request processed successfully," and generates a structured plan/command: {"action": "take_off", "parameters": {"target": 0, "altitude": 152.4}}. It correctly interpreted "angels five-zero" (5000 ft) and converted it to meters (152.4 m). The target: 0  indicates all applicable units. This demonstrates the agent translating natural language intent into executable RPC parameters via its internal Function Classifier and Function Matcher selecting the take_off function.  The 3D map view is now labeled "3D Real World (Simulated)" (Timestamp: 00:43).  The user refines the command slightly: "all units cleared. take off to angels five-zero in meters".  The agent processes this, generating a new plan: {"action": "take_off", "parameters": {"altitude": 50, "target": 0}}. It correctly interprets that "angels five-zero in meters" means 50 meters, overriding the typical "angels" slang meaning.
•	(01:09 - 01:34) The user clicks "Execute Plan". The drones (represented by icons) begin taking off in both the 2D and 3D "Real World (Simulated)" maps. Status information (Heading, Altitude, Height AGL, Speed) appears for Drone 7 in the top right.
•	 (01:34 - 01:53) The user issues a more complex command for a specific unit: "Drone Niner, come right to heading zero-niner-zero. Push 50 meters at 20 mikes per second. Climb to angels seven-zero."  The agent processes this command.
o	The "Prediction Map" (Timestamp: 01:43) now activates, showing the predicted future state of Drone 9 after executing the command (icon moved, labeled "Drone 9 (Predicted) Alt: 2134ft"). This demonstrates the Digital Twin's predictive capability.
o	The agent generates multiple structured commands for the Function Service to execute:
	{"action": "set_heading", "parameters": {"target": 9, "heading": 90}}
	{"action": "move", "parameters": {"target": 9, "altitude": 0, "distance": 50, "speed": 20}} (Altitude 0 likely means relative/maintain current, speed is interpreted from "mikes")
	{"action": "move", "parameters": {"target": 9, "altitude": 2134}} (Climb to 7000ft, converted to 2134m)
o	(Scene continues with execution)















Scene 3: Multi-Drone Maneuvers and RTB (01:53 - 05:54)


•	 (01:53 - 02:15) The user clicks "Execute Plan". The system logs "[AM] executed" for the Drone 9 commands. Drone 9 begins turning and moving on the maps according to the plan.  An "Action" arrow is overlaid on the "Real World (Simulated)" map (Timestamp: 02:15), visually indicating the currently executing maneuver for Drone 9, reflecting the static prediction.

•	 (02:34 - 02:59) The user inputs a complex multi-agent command: "Deploy Drones Alpha through Delta in a tactical square formation. Put each asset at a vertex of a 100-meter perimeter box. Maintain 100-meter spacing between adjacent units."  The agent processes this complex spatial reasoning task. It generates a batch of actions for multiple drones (Targets 1, 2, 3, 4 likely correspond to Alpha-Delta) involving setting headings and moving specific distances to achieve the square formation. The generated parameters include target IDs, actions (set_heading, move), and parameters like altitude, distance, speed, and heading.
•	 (02:59 - 03:45) The user clicks "Execute Plan". The system logs "[AM] executed" multiple times as the batched commands are sent via DDS RPC (batch_actions function). Drones 1, 2, 3, and 4 reposition themselves into the requested square formation on both maps. (Timestamp: 03:45) shows the drones having achieved or nearing the square formation.
•	 (03:54 - 05:54) The user issues a final command: "All units, execute RTB and initiate full recovery. Cleared for tactical landing at current LZ. Maintain spacing, confirm gear down."  The agent processes this, confirms the request, and generates a land command ({"action": "land", "parameters": {"target": 0}}), likely interpreting "RTB," "recovery," and "landing" into the appropriate action. The "gear down" confirmation might be handled implicitly by the landing function or logged separately.  The user clicks "Execute Plan". The system logs "[AM] executed". All drone icons on the maps begin moving back towards their likely origin/landing zone and start descending. The user repeats altitude queries during the landing process, showing the decreasing altitude values reported by the agent.

Scene 4: Integration with Existing Ecosystem (05:54 - 09:57)


•	 (05:54 - 06:25) The view transitions to a different interface. On the right is "ARDUPILOT Mission Planner," a common ground control station software, showing a satellite view. On the left is an RTI branded web interface showing a standard map view. Text overlays state "Existing Ecosystem Connections" and "Arbitrary DDS Connections" (Timestamp: 05:57). This scene demonstrates GENESIS integrating with external systems. The agent's commands (translated via a DDS-MAVLink bridge) are controlling simulated drones within Ardupilot. The Ardupilot interface shows "Vehicle 1" armed and in "Guided" mode (indicating external control). The RTI map on the left shows a drone icon (black 'X'). Clicking it reveals raw DDS data ({"id":"drone1","position":...}), including lat/lon, altitude, heading, pitch, roll, speed. This data is being published over DDS and subscribed to by this separate RTI web interface.  A red arrow highlights the URL bar of the RTI interface, showing an IP address (54.183.76.194:7400), emphasizing that this connection is happening over the network ("Even Remote" tag) (Timestamp: 06:25). Port 7400 is the default DDS discovery port.
•	 (06:40 - 09:57) The demo shows the drones continuing their landing sequence, now viewed simultaneously in the RTI map (receiving DDS position updates) and the Ardupilot Mission Planner (reflecting the simulated drone state). Icons converge on the landing zone. Clicking icons in the RTI map continues to show the underlying DDS data updates. This demonstrates DDS's ability to share data seamlessly between different systems (GENESIS agent -> DDS/MAVLink Bridge -> Ardupilot Sim -> DDS -> RTI Web UI).

Scene 5: Behind the Scenes - Network Monitoring (10:57 - 13:35)


•	 (10:57 - 11:45) The view changes to the "Network Monitor," a visualization of the underlying DDS communication graph. The overlay text reads "Behind the Scenes" (Timestamp: 10:57).  A diagram appears showing the DDS <> MAVLink <> Ardupilot bridge concept (Timestamp: 11:04), explaining how GENESIS likely interacts with the simulation environment shown previously. An arrow points to the specialized_agent node, labeling it "Agent" (Timestamp: 11:14). This represents the core reasoning component.  An arrow points to the central function node (connected to take_off, move, land, etc.), labeling it "Function Service" (Timestamp: 11:17). This represents the GenesisRPCService providing drone control capabilities.  Blue circles highlight the DDS entities involved in the agent-service interaction (requester, replier, function node), labeled "DDS Internal" (Timestamp: 11:24).  A green circle highlights the requester node connected to the specialized_agent, labeling it "Model API" (Timestamp: 11:32). This represents the interface through which the agent interacts with the underlying LLM. Text details the Agent's components (Function Classifier, Core Model, etc.).
•	 (11:45 - 13:35) The monitor demonstrates the dynamic nature of GENESIS and DDS:
o	Real-Time Arbitrary Function Insertion: (Timestamp: 12:01) Multiple new function service nodes (simple math functions like add, subtract, multiply, divide) appear dynamically on the network monitor as they are started externally.
o	Real-Time Agent Insertion: (Timestamp: 12:18) A new specialized_agent appears, connecting to the network.
o	Real-Time Interface Insertion: (Timestamp: 12:35) A new interface component appears.
o	The graph reorganizes dynamically as these new components discover each other via DDS. Hovering over nodes shows their DDS GUIDs and status (e.g., DISCOVERING).
o	Overlays highlight the key benefits: "Data Native Standards Based Fully Distributed" (Timestamp: 12:55) and "Safe Secure Reliable" (Timestamp: 13:15), tying the visual demonstration back to the core DDS and GENESIS principles.

Conclusion:

The demo effectively illustrates how GENESIS uses natural language processing to understand user intent, translates it into complex multi-agent plans, leverages a digital twin for prediction, executes actions via DDS-based RPC, monitors the system state, and seamlessly integrates with external tools and simulators like Ardupilot. The final network monitoring scene emphasizes the dynamic, discoverable, and resilient nature of the underlying DDS communication fabric that enables GENESIS.
